#About Me

My name is Elliott Walters. I am currently enrolled in the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU through the Heinz college. I work at CMU and a major part of my job involves talking about data with doctoral and masters students. I had some free time over the summer and thought a class like this might be beneficial for me to be able to provide some more guidance to students when we are working together and might help my work stand out more as well.

#What I Hope to Learn

Almost all of my professional writing and work comes out very bland. While the content is always there most of my graph and visualization do not look very interesting. I was thinking that taking a course like this might help me add some "pop" to my charts so that they stand out a bit more and start to make a bigger impact. I am especially interested in starting to use more color to help complex information be a little more intuative to my reader.
